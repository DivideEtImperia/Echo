## Echo Easy Scripts!
> Also known as the A.R.S Snippet System!  
  
If you are not very familiar with the A.R.S and would like an easy way to add commands  
Follow the instructions below!
  
### Permissions
> Make sure Echo has permissions in your server (And Channel)  
If the commands aren't working there is a great chance he has no permissions.  
  
### Installing Command
> Find the command you want in the table below, right click "Save link as"  
In a channel where Echo can read messages drag the file you saved to your channel  
Once the file uploads to Discord Echo will install the command(s).  
If everything worked right, he will list the commands that were installed.
