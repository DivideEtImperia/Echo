## This page is being converted to the new Echo Documentation
*On Dec. 27th 2016*  
  
### We have added so many keys, please give us some time to document them.  
And remember you can view a list of command, keys at [Echo Official Website](https://echo.xtclabs.net/)  
  

# Did you know!
You can have Echo link a trigger for Events.
  
Let's take a look at the keys:
```
{Event:Join}         // When someone joins the server.
{Event:Leave}         // When someone leaves the server.
{Event:MemberUpdate}    // When a member is updated.
{Event:RoleCreate}    // When a role is created.
{Event:RoleDelete}    // When a role is deleted.
{Event:ChannelCreate}    // When a channel is created.
{Event:ChannelDelete}    // When a channel is deleted.
{Event:ChannelUpdate}    // When a channel is updated.
{Event:RoleUpdate}    // When a role is updated.
{Event:GuildUpdate}    // When the guild is updated.
```
  
Now let's learn how to use these Event Keys to do something cool!  
The example below links an A.R.S to the event: **Join**  
This means when someone joins the server Echo will do something!
  
**STEP #1:**
```
.auto jnevnt=
   {protect}
   {Event:Join}
   {ars:
      mchk101
   }
```
Alright so what we are doing is protecting the key.
This means no one can call it or trigger it via typing.
Than we want to link to the **Join Event**
And last we want to link to another trigger. Read below!
  
Now we need to make another trigger. This time we encrypt it!  
  
**STEP #2:**
```
.auto64 mchk101=
   {protect}
   {sleep:15m}
   {role:
      Member
   }{pm}
   Hey user! I see you have been here for 15 minutes!
   I've added you to the role Member!
```
Alright that's it! Now let me explain what we are doing.
We're protecting the a.r.s rule so no one can call it **IMPORTANT**
We're making echo sleep for 15 minutes, if they user is still in your server  
Echo will give them the role **Member** and PM them alerting them.  
**auto64** is used to encrypt your response. To stray from peeking eyes.  
The owner can also **.inspect** the trigger to make changes etc..
  
  
# Are you A Developer?
### Echo can send your guild object, channels, roles & members to any site!
That's right, you can have a full fledged members list on your page.  
Along with roles, channels. You could basically create your own manager.  
And keep it 100% updated using Echos A.R.S System and the **{Events}** Keys.  
  
**Example Below:**  
  
Alright what we're going to do is have echo update the members to any site.  
For this example we will use **localhost**
**First Step:** You will want to make a **.php** file.  
In the file you want to make the file that catches the objects and than stores it.  
For this example we are simply saving the files to a .json in a directory.  
  
**PHP File**: Name it *collection.php*  
```php
<?php
$json = file_get_contents('php://input');
$srv = json_decode($json);

if(isset($_GET['gid'])) {
	if(! file_exists("Test/".$_GET['gid'])) {
		mkDir('Test/'.$_GET['gid'], 0777);
	}
}
if($_GET['id'] == "guild") {
	$myfile = fopen('Test/'.$_GET['gid'].'/guild.json', "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
	fwrite($myfile, json_encode($srv, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));
	fclose($myfile);
	// echo "Guild object has been saved to your PC.";
}
if($_GET['id'] == "channels") {
	$myfile = fopen('Test/'.$_GET['gid'].'/channels.json', "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
	fwrite($myfile, json_encode($srv, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));
	fclose($myfile);
	// echo "Channel object has been saved to your PC.";
}
if($_GET['id'] == "members") {
	$myfile = fopen('Test/'.$_GET['gid'].'/members.json', "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
	fwrite($myfile, json_encode($srv, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));
	fclose($myfile);
	// echo "Members object has been updated to your PC.";
}
if($_GET['id'] == "roles") {
	$myfile = fopen('Test/'.$_GET['gid'].'/roles.json', "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
	fwrite($myfile, json_encode($srv, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));
	fclose($myfile);
	// echo "Members object has been saved to your PC.";
}
?>
```
Alright now that you have your **Landing Page** Created let's move to Echo.  
**A.R.S Step #1:** Setting the main command up.  
```
.auto pform=
   {protect}
   {json|members:
      http://localhost/collection.php?id=members&gid={guild|id}
   }
```
**Notice:** Echo will respond with any errors  
He will also respond if you have it setup in the .php file to echo a repsonse.  
If you don't echo a response, Echo will not post anything.  
**A.R.S Step #2:** Linking the A.R.S To Events  
*Member Join Event*
```
.auto jnevnt=
   {protect}
   {Event:Join}
   {ars:
      pform
   }
```
*Member Leave Event*
```
.auto lvevnt=
   {protect}
   {Event:Leave}
   {ars:
      pform
   }
```
*Member Update Event*
```
.auto updevnt=
   {protect}
   {Event:MemberUpdate}
   {ars:
      pform
   }
```
**Alright that's it**!  
You don't have to do ANYTHING! Echo will detect the Event keys  
And act accordingly. You can only have **One of Each Event**  
Now when someone Joins, Updates or Leaves your server  
Echo will send the updated Members list to your page.  
You can do this with roles, channels. Or just send the  
Entire Guild object through, which has channels, roles, members inside.  
  
**List of All the JSON Form Post Rules:**  
```
{json|guild:http://link.to/yourpage.php?id=guild&gid={guild|id}}  
// Sends a json object of your entire guild.  
// This includes roles, members & channels.  
{json|members:http://link.to/yourpage.php?id=members&gid={guild|id}}  
// Sends a json object of just your members.  
{json|channels:http://link.to/yourpage.php?id=channels&gid={guild|id}}  
// Sends a json object of just your channels.  
{json|roles:http://link.to/yourpage.php?id=roles&gid={guild|id}}  
// Sends a json object of just your roles.  
```

# Auto Response System **101**
  
First i'd like to introduce **A.R.S Etiquette**.
  
**Not Proper:**
```
.auto &.give {params}={role:{params}}
```
  
**Proper:**
```
.auto &.give {params}=
{role:
   {params}
}
```
The reason we've added Ettiquette to A.R.S is to help people understand easily.  
When rules get super long and you've got it all crammed into a single line  
It can look daunting, and even steer people away from using our system.  
So, Practice proper A.R.S Ettiquette and you will notice a big difference!
  
  
Ok now let's look at the trigger section.  
You want to set this to whatever word/sentence you want Echo to respond to.  
  
  
<b>You can use the {params} key in the trigger to catch their text!</b> 
```
.auto &.giveme {params}=
{role:
   {params}
}{req:Owner}
{notreq:
   {/user} You're not the owner
}
You've assumed the role {params}
```
  
The example above `requires` you to have the role `Owner` and will give you  
whatever role you type (*As long as the role exists*) for example: `.giveme Staff`  
  
  
If you want to use regex you add the <b>&</b> key before the word Example Below:  
`.auto &word=The Response here!`  
Want to add a work like `ass` to the word filter? but don't want to catch `mass`?  
Add a space after the word. this will assure it only triggers on the word! Example Below:  
`.auto &ass =The Response here!`  
  
Ok, now let's look at the <b>Response</b> section and all the keys you can use!  
<b>Keys</b> are surrounded by obraces. `{key}` Echo will replace these keys with data!  
Here's tons of examples:  
  You can view the list of A.R.S Keys at [Echo's Website!](https://echo.xtclabs.net)  
  
  
  
### USING THE {PARAMS} KEY
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | .auto &.sayhi {params}=Your Message: {params}  |
| Use Command:  | `.sayhi hey guys!`  |
  
  
### SERVER INFO COMMAND
Alright let's make a **"Server Info"** command    
  
in your server type this exactly:  
```php
.auto .server={embed:
    {title:Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|name:{owner|name}}
    {author|icon:{owner|avatar}}
    {author|url:{owner|avatar}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
───────────────────────
× ID:                     {guild|id}
× Region:             {guild|region}
× OwnerID:        {owner|id}
× Discord Icon:  [Click to view Guild Icon]({guild|icon})
× Members:       {membercount}
× Channels:        {channelcount}
× Roles:               {rolecount}
───────────────────────
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
Now when you type **.server** Echo will display the server information.  
You can set it up to list all the channels, the server prefix. all that stuff!
  
  
### WHOAMI COMMAND
```php
.auto .whoami=
{embed:
    {title:User Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|icon:{usericon}}
    {author|name:{/user}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
Bot Master: *{ismaster}*
Discord Icon: [Click here for Icon]({usericon})
Discord ID: *{rawid}*
Roles: *{listroles}*
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
pretty neat huh? :)  
  
### Using IF Statements with Echo.
The IF statements are very basic at the moment.  
However there are plans to make it more dynamic.  
Below we are going to use an if sstatement to block  
a command from the **#general** Channel.
```
.auto .boobs=
{if:
	channel!=general
}{boobs}
```
Basically what we're doing above is..  
People will be able to use **.boobs** in any channel.  
Except for #general channel.  
  
Alright now let's do the same but for a user.  
Let's make it so No One BUT **Proxy** Can use a command.
```
.auto .boobs=
{if:
	user==Proxy
}{boobs}
```
Alright! Now you understand the If statements.  
However, Make sure to keep checking back as this will change.  
  
### WORD FILTER EXAMPLE:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &fuck={del}{pm}{kick}You've been kicked for swearing.`  |

### CUSTOM `.getid` COMMAND:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &.grabid {params}={rawid}The user's ID: {params}`  |

Alright that was fun, Now let's make a Sexy Meme & Jokes Command.
```
.auto .joke=
{embed:
    {title:Random Fucking Jokes}
    {url:https://api.xtclabs.net}
    {type:rich}
    {desc:

       }
    }
    {footer|text:
        Requested: {/user}
    }{footer|icon:
    {usericon}
    }
}
```

And now the Memes:
```
.auto .meme=
{embed:
    {title:
        {randlist:

    {type:rich}
    {color:
        {randlist2:
            #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
            #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
            #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {image|url:
