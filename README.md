## This page is being converted to the new Echo Documentation
*On Dec. 27th 2016*  
  
### We have added so many keys, please give us some time to document them.  
And remember you can view a list of command, keys at [Echo Official Website](https://echo.xtclabs.net/)  
  

# Echo + Pure Regex!
Alright everyone! Something that was widely requested in Echo **1.x** Is here!  
Echo can parse and (for now) lightly manipulate content based off pure Regex!  
  
First we need to introduce you to a new identifier in the trigger.  
`{:}` identifier is used to let echo know your trigger will be **Pure Regex**  
However, you still need to add the `&` trigger before hand. Let's check out the example below:  
```php
.auto &{:}(a{3})={init}
Hey {/user} you said aaa
```
Notice how we keep the Identifier `&` before the `{:}` this is important.  
  
This time we are going to detect some special characters and than have echo replace them.  
```
.auto &{:}[^][.,_'0-9a-zA-Z -]={init}
{%replace|with:TEST}
```
For now the manipulation is basic. But this will change as the system grows!  
But what we're doing is having Echo detect all the special characters  
like `~!@#$%^&*()+` however he ignores a few as well. `_[],.space`  
And than he will post a message replacing each char with `TEST`  
  
If you're newer to regex there are a few websites that can push you along.  
[Regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)  
  
  
# Introducing the new If Statments!
Echo now has the power to use (somewhat) comples if statements!  
Before we start I want to make sure you understand `use |`  
**use |** is a way to define what your if statement is looking for.  
Here's a little example. we're going to use my `Discord ID`

```php
use | 146046383726657536
```
Now you can also define multiple users,roles,channels.  
However **you can't mix defines**. meaning you can't have this  
```php
use | USERID | CHANNELID | Role Name
```
The above example will not work, when you're using an if statement  
You're defining the statement itself with `(isuser)` or `(ischannel)`, `(hasrole)`  
So you need to define the proper IDS with the Statement.  

**HasRole** When you're defining a role don't worry, you don't need the id.  
Instead it's the **Case Sensitive** name. Example below:
```php
use | Admin
```
And you can check as many roles as you need example below:
```php
use | Admin | Owner | Developers
```
So if **Bob** Has `Admin` and **Tom** Does __not__, However **Tom** Has `Developers` role.
Echo will respond with the response. If **Bob** and **Tom** Has neither, echo will not respond.  

### If Statement - Restrict command to User(s)
```php
.auto .test2={init}
use | 146046383726657536
{if(isuser):
    {/user} can use this command!
} (else) {
    {/user} doesn't have access to this command.
}
```
Make sure to __Read above__ to learn how to define multiple users.  
  
### If Statement - Restrict command to Channel(s)
```php
.auto .test={init}
use | 265348251266449409
{if(ischannel):
    This command will work!
} (else) {
    {/user} this command is restricted from this channel.
}
```
  
### If Statement - Restrict command to Role(s)
```php
.auto .test3={init}
use | Admin
{if(hasrole):
    {/user} has the role Admin
} (else) {
    {/user} doesn't have the role Admin
}
```
  
### Single lined if statement
```php
.auto .test3={init}use | Admin{if(hasrole):You have the role!} (else) {You don't have the role!}
```
  
# Echo + Virus Total!
> Protect your members!  
  
Do you want a safe place to post links? Not have to worry about malicious activity?  
xTech Labs Introduces `Echo + Virus Total` Initiative.  
We're on a mission, To keep your Discord Information where it belongs. With you and ONLY you!  

### Step 1: Links!
What Echo can do is delete every `unknown` link and than use Virus Total to scan.  
If the link comes back safe, Echo will repost the URL and the original Author.  
Echo in return adds the `safe url` to his cache system.  
However if your link is a short url, it will remain in his cache for 1 week.  
And than the link will be considered `unknown` once again.  
Ok let me show you how to make this system.  
 
```php
.auto &http://={init}
{checkurl:
	{/user} Please wait while we inspect your link..
}{whitelist:
	https://yoursite.com,
	https://site2.com
}
```
What we're telling echo to do here is: Check every message that has an `http://` in the Content.  
And than scan the URL using Virus Total!  
  
   
# Did you know?
You can have Echo link a trigger for Events! For example, if someone joins  
or leaves, updates. Channel updates. All of it!
  
[View Echo A.R.S Events](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo/wiki/A.R.S-Events)  

# Are you A Developer?
### Echo can send your guild object, channels, roles & members to any site!
That's right, you can have a full fledged members list on your page.  
Along with roles, channels. You could basically create your own manager.  
And keep it 100% updated using Echos A.R.S System and the **{Events}** Keys.  
  
[View Echo for Devs](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo/wiki/Echo-for-Devs)  

# Multiple A.R.S Profiles & .grabars!
We've made it so you can store multiple A.R.S Profiles  
And than load, save at any time.  
  
[View Echo A.R.S Profiles](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo/wiki/A.R.S-Profiles)  
  
# Auto Response System **101**
  
[View Echo A.R.S Etiquette](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo/wiki/A.R.S-Etiquette)  
  
  
<b>You can use the {params} key in the trigger to catch their text!</b> 
```php
.auto &.giveme {params}={init}
{role:
   {params}
}{req:Owner}
{notreq:
   {/user} You're not the owner
}
You've assumed the role {params}
```
  
The example above `requires` you to have the role `Owner` and will give you  
whatever role you type (*As long as the role exists*) for example: `.giveme Staff`  
  
  
If you want to use regex you add the <b>&</b> key before the word Example Below:  
`.auto &word={init}The Response here!`  
Want to add a work like `ass` to the word filter? but don't want to catch `mass`?  
Add a space after the word. this will assure it only triggers on the word! Example Below:  
`.auto &ass ={init}The Response here!`  
  
Ok, now let's look at the <b>Response</b> section and all the keys you can use!  
<b>Keys</b> are surrounded by obraces. `{key}` Echo will replace these keys with data!  
Here's tons of examples:  
  You can view the list of A.R.S Keys at [Echo's Website!](https://echo.xtclabs.net)  
  
  
# A.R.S Examples.
You can view the [Public A.R.S Library](https://webm.xtclabs.net} Click Tools->A.R.S.  
  
### USING THE {PARAMS} KEY
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | .auto &.sayhi {params}={init}Your Message: {params}  |
| Use Command:  | `.sayhi hey guys!`  |
  
  
### PREVENT MULTI-LINE MESSAGES WITH REGEX!
```php
.auto &{:}(\n)={init}
{if:channel==echo-test}
{del}Whoa {/user}.. Not in here
```
First you need to replace `echo-test` with whatever channel you want to prevent multi-line chat.  
Basically what this does is. If Echo senses any multi-line (where they hit shift+enter)  
He will remove their message and display a message letting them know.  
**Notice** This doesn't remove long messages in a single line. Only if they hit (shift+enter)  
  
  
### SERVER INFO COMMAND
Alright let's make a **"Server Info"** command    
  
in your server type this exactly:  
```php
.auto .server={init}
{embed:
    {title:Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|name:{owner|name}}
    {author|icon:{owner|avatar}}
    {author|url:{owner|avatar}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
───────────────────────
× ID:                     {guild|id}
× Region:             {guild|region}
× OwnerID:        {owner|id}
× Discord Icon:  [Click to view Guild Icon]({guild|icon})
× Members:       {membercount}
× Channels:        {channelcount}
× Roles:               {rolecount}
───────────────────────
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
Now when you type `.server` Echo will display the server information.  
You can set it up to list all the channels, roles & the server prefix. all that stuff!
  
  
### WHOAMI COMMAND
```php
.auto .whoami={init}
{embed:
    {title:User Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|icon:{usericon}}
    {author|name:{/user}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
Bot Master: *{ismaster}*
Discord Icon: [Click here for Icon]({usericon})
Discord ID: *{rawid}*
Roles: *{listroles}*
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
now just type `.whoami`
  
### Embeds with Multiple Fields!
```php
.auto .echo={init}
{embed:
    {type:rich}
        {color:
            {randlist:
                #4286f4,#ff0000,#00ff00,
                ##e8f442,#f49e42,#000000
            }
        }
    {image|url:https://xtclabs.net/img/EchoIcon.jpg}
    {image|width:250}
    {image|height:250}
    {field[0]|name:Echo}
    {field[0]|value:[Echo Official Website](https://echo.xtclabs.net "The Official website for Echo 2.0")}
    {field[0]|inline:true}
    {field[1]|name:Echo Help}
    {field[1]|value:[Echo Documentation](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo "Learn how to use Echo A.R.S Through some Examples.")}
    {field[1]|inline:true}
    {field[2]|name:AutoGo}
    {field[2]|value:[AutoGo Website!](https://autogo.xtclabs.net "AutoGo! A bot like Echo 1.x You run yourself!")}
    {field[2]|inline:true}
    {field[3]|name:Web Manager}
    {field[3]|value:[Discord Server Manager](https://webm.xtclabs.net "Manage Your discord server and Echo from the world wide web!")}
    {field[3]|inline:true}
    {field[4]|name:PHP Webhooks}
    {field[4]|value:[Github Page!](https://github.com/proxikal/discordphp-webhook "Use discord webhooks with ease using DiscordPHP-Webhooks")}
    {field[4]|inline:true}
    {field[5]|name:xTech Labs API}
    {field[5]|value:[View Website](https://api.xtclabs.net/ "xTech Labs offers free API endpoints like memes, jokes etc..")}
    {field[5]|inline:true}
    {footer|text:Requested by: {/user}.}
    {footer|icon:{usericon}}
}
```
now just type `.echo` 
You are allowed 10 fields. `field[0]` through `field[9]`  
  
### Restricting Boobs & Ass command to channel(s)
```php
.auto .boobs={init}
use | YOUR-CHANNEL-ID
{if(ischannel):
    {boobs}
} (else) {
    {stop}
}
```
Basically what we're doing above is..  
People will be able to use **.boobs** in any channel.  
you choose. You need to replace `YOUR-CHANNEL-ID` with the channel  
you want to allow the boobs command in. You can also add multiple channels.  
`use | CHANNELID | CHANNELID`  
  
Alright now let's do the same but for `{ass}` key! 
```php
.auto .ass={init}
use | YOUR-CHANNEL-ID
{if(ischannel):
    {ass}
} (else) {
    {stop}
}
```
  
## Echo's A.R.S Is not a good way to filter out words.
There is a Rate Limiter Governing the A.R.S, So when someone spams `fuck` echo takes time to catch up.  
So Only use the below example if you really need to. Otherwise just use Echo's `WordFilter` command  
### WORD FILTER EXAMPLE:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &fuck={init}{del}{pm}{kick}You've been kicked for swearing.`  |
| If Typed  | The message gets deleted and echo will send a pm of the above message.  |
  
  
### GET ALERTS ON TRIGGERS
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &<@YOURIDHERE>={init}{alert:YOURIDHERE}I have alerted Proxy!`  |
| If Typed  | Echo will private message you and let the user know.<br>You can get your id with `.getid @User`  |
  
  
### CUSTOM `.getid` COMMAND:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &.grabid {params}={init}{rawid}The user's ID: {params}`  |
| Use Command  | `.grabdid @User`  |
  
  
**{rawid}** is required along with **{params}** to display another users ID.  
  
### Build the `.meme` or `.jokes` command
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto .meme={init}{meme}`  |
| Use Command  | `.meme`  |
  
  
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `auto .joke={init}{joke}`  |
| Use Command  | `.joke`  |
  
  
Alright that was fun, Now let's make a Sexy Meme & Jokes Command.
```
.auto .joke={init}
{embed:
    {title:Random Jokes}
    {url:https://api.xtclabs.net}
    {type:rich}
    {desc:
        {joke}
    }
    {color:
       {randlist:
          #4286f4,#ff0000,
          #00ff00,##e8f442,
          #f49e42,#000000
       }
    }
    {footer|text:
        Requested: {/user}
    }{footer|icon:
    {usericon}
    }
}
```

And now the Memes:
```
.auto .meme={init}
{embed:
    {title:Random Memes!}
    {url:https://api.xtclabs.net}
    {type:rich}
    {color:
        {randlist2:
            #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
            #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
            #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {image|url:
        {meme}
    }
    {image|width:250}
    {image|height:250}
    {footer|text:Requested: {/user}}
    {footer|icon:
        {usericon}
    }
}
```
As you can see i've added my personal jokes and memes command.  
These rules have extra features, like random colors and random titles!  
You can remove or configure anything you please.
