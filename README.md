# Support Staff Openings.
> You need to have knowledge in the A.R.S and his Commands.  
The commands aren't as big of an issue as the A.R.S 
  
### Professional, Knowledgeable & Good Attitude!
> Good manners! And the ability to join servers to help with any special case.  
PM: Your pm needs to be open for anyone to ask for help, we have a support channel.  
But if they message you in your PM, Don't ask them to re-type in support.  
  
### Independence!
> Study! Because the A.R.S Is big! And it's only going to get bigger.  
We need you to be able to fix problems yourself. (Minor bugging of Management is fine)  
Don't message our moderators to help someone else. (They are only there to kick, ban & keep the peace)  
  
Is all of this too much? Just want the commands you see below with ease?  
We have a few files with some preset commands! All you have to do is..  
Step 1: Download one of the snippet files you want in [Easy Scripts Folder](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo/tree/master/EasyScripts)  
Step 2: Drag the file(s) you want into a channel Echo has permissions to read messages in.  
If all went well, you will see the new commands listed under the file your uploaded.  
And available for you to use!

# Auto Response System **101**
> Here are some examples to help you along.
  
<b>You can use the {params} key in the trigger to catch their text!</b> 
```php
.auto &.giveme {params}={init}
{role:
   {params}
}{req:Owner}
{notreq:
   {/user} You're not the owner
}
You've assumed the role {params}
```
  
The example above `requires` you to have the role `Owner` and will give you  
whatever role you type (*As long as the role exists*) for example: `.giveme Staff`  
  
  
If you want to use regex you add the <b>&</b> key before the word Example Below:  
`.auto &word={init}The Response here!`  
Want to add a work like `ass` to the word filter? but don't want to catch `mass`?  
Add a space after the word. this will assure it only triggers on the word! Example Below:  
`.auto &ass ={init}The Response here!`  
  
Ok, now let's look at the <b>Response</b> section and all the keys you can use!  
<b>Keys</b> are surrounded by obraces. `{key}` Echo will replace these keys with data!  
Here's tons of examples:  
  You can view the list of A.R.S Keys at [Echo's Website!](https://echo.xtclabs.net)  
  
  
# A.R.S Examples.
You can view the [Public A.R.S Library](https://webm.xtclabs.net} Click Tools->A.R.S.  
  
### USING THE {PARAMS} KEY
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | .auto &.sayhi {params}={init}Your Message: {params}  |
| Use Command:  | `.sayhi hey guys!`  |
  
  
### PREVENT MULTI-LINE MESSAGES WITH REGEX!
```php
.auto &{:}(\n)={init}
use | YOUR-CHANNEL-ID
{if(ischannel):
    {del}Whoa {/user}.. Not in here
} (else) {
    {stop}
}
```
First you need to replace `YOUR-CHANNEL-ID` with whatever channel you want to prevent multi-line chat.  
Basically what this does is. If Echo senses any multi-line (where they hit shift+enter)  
He will remove their message and display a message letting them know.  
**Notice** This doesn't remove long messages in a single line. Only if they hit (shift+enter)  
  
  
### SERVER INFO COMMAND
Alright let's make a **"Server Info"** command    
  
in your server type this exactly:  
```php
.auto .server={init}
{embed:
    {title:Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|name:{owner|name}}
    {author|icon:{owner|avatar}}
    {author|url:{owner|avatar}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
───────────────────────
× ID:                     {guild|id}
× Region:             {guild|region}
× OwnerID:        {owner|id}
× Discord Icon:  [Click to view Guild Icon]({guild|icon})
× Members:       {membercount}
× Channels:        {channelcount}
× Roles:               {rolecount}
───────────────────────
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
Now when you type `.server` Echo will display the server information.  
You can set it up to list all the channels, roles & the server prefix. all that stuff!
  
  
### WHOAMI COMMAND
```php
.auto .whoami={init}
{embed:
    {title:User Information for {guild|name}}
    {type:rich}
    {author|icon:{usericon}}
    {author|name:{/user}}
    {color:
        {randlist:
             #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
             #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
             #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {thumb|url:{guild|icon}}
    {desc:
Bot Master: *{ismaster}*
Discord Icon: [Click here for Icon]({usericon})
Discord ID: *{rawid}*
Roles: *{listroles}*
    }
    {footer|icon:https://xtclabs.net/img/favicon-new.png}
    {footer|text: Echo 2.0 A.R.S}
}
```
now just type `.whoami`
  
### Embeds with Multiple Fields!
```php
.auto .echo={init}
{embed:
    {type:rich}
        {color:
            {randlist:
                #4286f4,#ff0000,#00ff00,
                ##e8f442,#f49e42,#000000
            }
        }
    {image|url:https://xtclabs.net/img/EchoIcon.jpg}
    {image|width:250}
    {image|height:250}
    {field[0]|name:Echo}
    {field[0]|value:[Echo Official Website](https://echo.xtclabs.net "The Official website for Echo 2.0")}
    {field[0]|inline:true}
    {field[1]|name:Echo Help}
    {field[1]|value:[Echo Documentation](https://github.com/proxikal/Echo "Learn how to use Echo A.R.S Through some Examples.")}
    {field[1]|inline:true}
    {field[2]|name:AutoGo}
    {field[2]|value:[AutoGo Website!](https://autogo.xtclabs.net "AutoGo! A bot like Echo 1.x You run yourself!")}
    {field[2]|inline:true}
    {field[3]|name:Web Manager}
    {field[3]|value:[Discord Server Manager](https://webm.xtclabs.net "Manage Your discord server and Echo from the world wide web!")}
    {field[3]|inline:true}
    {field[4]|name:PHP Webhooks}
    {field[4]|value:[Github Page!](https://github.com/proxikal/discordphp-webhook "Use discord webhooks with ease using DiscordPHP-Webhooks")}
    {field[4]|inline:true}
    {field[5]|name:xTech Labs API}
    {field[5]|value:[View Website](https://api.xtclabs.net/ "xTech Labs offers free API endpoints like memes, jokes etc..")}
    {field[5]|inline:true}
    {footer|text:Requested by: {/user}.}
    {footer|icon:{usericon}}
}
```
now just type `.echo` 
You are allowed 10 fields. `field[0]` through `field[9]`  
  
### Restricting Boobs & Ass command to channel(s)
```php
.auto .boobs={init}
use | YOUR-CHANNEL-ID
{if(ischannel):
    {boobs}
} (else) {
    {stop}
}
```
Basically what we're doing above is..  
People will be able to use **.boobs** in any channel.  
you choose. You need to replace `YOUR-CHANNEL-ID` with the channel  
you want to allow the boobs command in. You can also add multiple channels.  
`use | CHANNELID | CHANNELID`  
  
Alright now let's do the same but for `{ass}` key! 
```php
.auto .ass={init}
use | YOUR-CHANNEL-ID
{if(ischannel):
    {ass}
} (else) {
    {stop}
}
```
  
## Echo's A.R.S Is not a good way to filter out words.
There is a Rate Limiter Governing the A.R.S, So when someone spams `fuck` echo takes time to catch up.  
So Only use the below example if you really need to. Otherwise just use Echo's `WordFilter` command  
### WORD FILTER EXAMPLE:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &fuck={init}{del}{pm}{kick}You've been kicked for swearing.`  |
| If Typed  | The message gets deleted and echo will send a pm of the above message.  |
  
  
### GET ALERTS ON TRIGGERS
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &<@YOURIDHERE>={init}{alert:YOURIDHERE}I have alerted Proxy!`  |
| If Typed  | Echo will private message you and let the user know.<br>You can get your id with `.getid @User`  |
  
  
### CUSTOM `.getid` COMMAND:
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto &.grabid {params}={init}{rawid}The user's ID: {params}`  |
| Use Command  | `.grabdid @User`  |
  
  
**{rawid}** is required along with **{params}** to display another users ID.  
  
### Build the `.meme` or `.jokes` command
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `.auto .meme={init}{meme}`  |
| Use Command  | `.meme`  |
  
  
| Steps  | You Type  |
| :--:  | :--:  |
| Make Command  | `auto .joke={init}{joke}`  |
| Use Command  | `.joke`  |
  
  
Alright that was fun, Now let's make a Sexy Meme & Jokes Command.
```
.auto .joke={init}
{embed:
    {title:Random Jokes}
    {url:https://api.xtclabs.net}
    {type:rich}
    {desc:
        {joke}
    }
    {color:
       {randlist:
          #4286f4,#ff0000,
          #00ff00,##e8f442,
          #f49e42,#000000
       }
    }
    {footer|text:
        Requested: {/user}
    }{footer|icon:
    {usericon}
    }
}
```

And now the Memes:
```
.auto .meme={init}
{embed:
    {title:Random Memes!}
    {url:https://api.xtclabs.net}
    {type:rich}
    {color:
        {randlist2:
            #ff0000,#00ff00,#ffffff,#4286f4,
            #f45642,#262525,#e2d626,#87e226,
            #26e2c0,#2633e2,#8126e2
        }
    }
    {image|url:
        {meme}
    }
    {image|width:250}
    {image|height:250}
    {footer|text:Requested: {/user}}
    {footer|icon:
        {usericon}
    }
}
```
As you can see i've added my personal jokes and memes command.  
These rules have extra features, like random colors and random titles!  
You can remove or configure anything you please.
